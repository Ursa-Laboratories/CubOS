"""Shared movement helpers for protocol commands.

CubOS uses a +Z-up deck frame and labware-relative action heights.

* ``measurement_height`` and ``interwell_scan_height`` are *labware-relative*
  offsets above (positive) or below (negative) the labware's surface
  reference Z (the deck-frame Z carried by the resolved well/labware
  coordinate). Both are first-class arguments to the protocol commands
  that use them (``measure`` and ``scan`` for ``measurement_height``,
  ``scan`` for ``interwell_scan_height``). Instruments do not carry them.
* Inter-labware travel uses the gantry's absolute ``safe_z``, exposed on
  ``Board.safe_z``.

There is no inter-labware helper. Callers compose the motion explicitly:
``board.move_to_labware`` (travels at ``safe_z``) followed by
``board.move`` to descend to the per-labware action plane.
