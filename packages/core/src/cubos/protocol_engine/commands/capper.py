"""Protocol commands for generic vial capper/decapper operations.

``decap``/``cap`` are built entirely from generic gantry primitives
(``InstrumentedGantry.move_to_labware``/``.move``, exactly like every other
instrument command) plus the vendor-agnostic
``cubos.instruments.capper.interface.CapperInstrument`` surface. No
vendor-specific behavior (Arduino command IDs, electromagnet, line-break
sensor parsing) appears here -- see
``cubos.instruments.capper.vendors.pawduino`` for that.

Sequencing is fixed and explicit for every decap/cap action:

1. **approach** -- travel to the vial XY at the gantry's absolute ``safe_z``
   (``InstrumentedGantry.move_to_labware``).
2. **engage** -- descend to ``vial.z + capper.engage_depth_mm`` (a
   labware-relative offset carried on the *instrument config*, not
   hardcoded here -- see ``CapperInstrument.engage_depth_mm``).
3. **actuate** -- ``capture_cap``/``release_cap`` at engage depth.
4. **retract + confirm** -- ascend back to ``safe_z``, THEN sensor-confirm
   (``read_cap_present``) the expected state, retrying (re-engage, actuate,
   retract, read) up to ``capper.capture_retries`` times. The confirm must
   happen after the retract: at engage depth the line-break beam is broken
   by the cap whether it is held by the tool or sitting on the vial, so the
   reading is meaningless until the tool has lifted clear.
5. **park** -- move to the instrument's configured ``park_position`` at
   ``safe_z``, so a captured/just-released cap is never left hovering over
   open labware.

A timeout or a sensor reading that contradicts the expected state after all
retries FAILS CLOSED: the tool is retracted to ``safe_z`` on a best-effort
basis, the durable cap state (when tracking is active) is marked
``reconciliation_required``, and a ``ProtocolExecutionError`` is raised --
no cap-state transition is recorded as applied. The same safe-retract path
runs for a mid-motion gantry failure at any stage, not just a sensor fault.
