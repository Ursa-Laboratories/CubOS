# Data

CubOS stores campaign state, experiment rows, measurement results, and labware
contents in a local SQLite database. Hardware runs save results automatically —
no setup and no external database server required.

## Database Path

By default, results are written to:

```text
data/databases/panda_data.db
```

Set `CUBOS_DATA_DB_PATH` to write a run to a different file. After a
successful run, analysis-friendly CSV exports are also written under
`data/results/`.

## What Gets Stored

| Table | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `campaigns` | Run grouping, config path metadata, creation time, status. |
| `experiments` | One row per measured labware location within a campaign. |
| `uvvis_measurements` | Wavelengths, intensities, integration time. |
| `filmetrics_measurements` | Thickness and goodness-of-fit. |
| `uv_curing_measurements` | UV intensity, exposure duration, and cure timestamp. |
| `camera_measurements` | Image path results. |
| `asmi_measurements` | Force/z/time series, baseline stats, force-limit metadata. |
| `potentiostat_measurements` | OCP/CA/CV/CP time, voltage, current, and technique metadata. |
| `labware` | Per-well or per-vial volume and contents tracking. |

`scan` stores one experiment row per well, `measure` one row for the target
position, and pipette `transfer` updates labware contents.

## CSV Export

Export helpers require pandas:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

List experiment IDs for a campaign:

```bash
python -m data.export_helpers \
  --db-path runs/example.db \
  campaign-experiments 1 \
  --csv runs/campaign_1_experiments.csv
```

Export all measurements for one experiment:

```bash
python -m data.export_helpers \
  --db-path runs/example.db \
  experiment-all 42 \
  --csv runs/experiment_42_measurements.csv
```

Export one supported instrument table for an experiment:

```bash
python -m data.export_helpers \
  --db-path runs/example.db \
  experiment-instrument 42 asmi \
  --csv runs/experiment_42_asmi.csv
```

If `--csv` is omitted, the helper prints the table to stdout.
